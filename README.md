# Hi there! 

I'm Nikita, a design engineer based in Russia. I like building clean, modern interfaces with smooth animations and keeping things simple.

## These days I'm focused on:

- React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Python and GO
- UI components with subtle motion
- Small, thoughtful projects with polish

## Some stuff I built:

- <a href="https://github.com/zokuuu/dotfiles" target="_blank">**Dotfiles**</a> – My everyday driving tools. Simple and pretty
- <a href="https://github.com/zokuuu/swiply" target="_blank">**Swiply**</a> - Swipe right to like, swipe left to pass — discover amazing products in a fun, Tinder-like interface!

## Fun Facts:

- I like tea more than coffee
- Hobbies: readings and try analog tools for life
